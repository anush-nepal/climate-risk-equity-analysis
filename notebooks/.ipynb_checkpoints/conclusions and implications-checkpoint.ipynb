    "# Climate Risk Premium Analysis: Conclusions and Implications\n",
    "**Project**: Analyzing Climate Risk Premiums in US Equity Markets  \n",
    "**Notebook**: 4. Conclusions and Implications  \n",
    "**Author**: Anush Nepal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "This analysis examined whether climate events create abnormal returns in equity markets using 8 years of daily stock data (2017-2024) from 45 companies across three climate-sensitive sectors. Contrary to common assumptions, statistical testing reveals that climate events are associated with **statistically significant positive abnormal returns** rather than negative impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Research Question\n",
    "**Do investors price climate risk into equity valuations, and do climate events create measurable abnormal returns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Summary\n",
    "- **Sample**: 90,424 daily observations from 45 companies (Energy, Insurance, Real Estate)\n",
    "- **Time Period**: January 2017 - December 2024\n",
    "- **Climate Events**: 7 major events (hurricanes, wildfires, extreme weather)\n",
    "- **Statistical Methods**: Event study methodology, t-tests, confidence intervals\n",
    "- **Event Windows**: Â±10 days around each climate event\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclosure**: This analysis was conducted independently with all data collection, statistical testing, and interpretation performed by the author. Claude AI was used to help structure and refine the presentation of findings in this conclusions notebook."

    "### Methodological Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Selection Bias**\n",
    "- Analysis limited to large-cap companies that survived the entire study period\n",

    "\n",
    "**Geographic and Temporal Scope**\n",
    "- Limited to US equity markets (2017-2024)\n",
    "- Climate impact patterns may differ in other countries or time periods\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis challenges conventional assumptions about climate risk in financial markets. Using rigorous event study methodology on 90,424 observations across 45 companies, the evidence demonstrates that climate events are associated with statistically significant positive abnormal returns rather than negative impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Evidence**\n",
    "- First comprehensive event study of climate events across multiple sectors using modern data\n",
    "- Statistically significant positive abnormal returns (p < 0.001) during climate event windows\n",
    "- Quantified sector-specific risk-return profiles for climate-sensitive industries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological Rigor**\n",
    "- Applied standard financial econometric techniques to climate risk analysis\n",
    "- Controlled for market-wide effects through comparison with normal trading periods\n",
    "- Used multiple statistical tests to validate findings across different specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Relevance**\n",
    "- Results inform investment strategy and portfolio construction decisions\n",
    "- Provides evidence base for regulatory policy on climate risk disclosure\n",
    "- Challenges existing climate risk assessment frameworks used in financial planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between climate events and equity returns appears more complex than traditional risk models suggest. While climate change represents a long-term systemic risk, short-term market reactions to discrete climate events may create profitable opportunities rather than losses. This finding has important implications for how investors, regulators, and policymakers approach climate-related financial risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical significance and economic magnitude of these results warrant further investigation across broader samples, longer time periods, and different market conditions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial as climate events become more frequent and financial markets continue to evolve their pricing of environmental risks."
